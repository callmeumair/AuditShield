## 1. Purpose of Pilot
The purpose of this Pilot Agreement is to grant the Customer access to the AuditShield platform for a limited time to evaluate its capability to:
1.  Ingest and log AI usage events.
2.  Enforce defined governance policies.
3.  Generate tamper-evident, cryptographically signed compliance reports.

## 2. Scope of Access
*   **Platform Access**: Customer is granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access the AuditShield SaaS dashboard and API.
*   **User Limit**: Unlimited users within the Customer's Identity Provider domain.
*   **Usage Volume**: Up to 10M logged events per month (soft limit).
*   **Support**: Standard business hour support via email.

## 3. Duration & Termination
*   **Term**: The Pilot Period shall commence on the [Start Date] and continue for sixty (60) days.
*   **Auto-Termination**: Access automatically terminates at the end of the 60-day period unless converted to an Annual Agreement.
*   **Rights to Terminate**: Either party may terminate the pilot with 5 written days' notice.
*   **No Automatic Renewal**: This agreement does *not* auto-renew into a paid subscription. Conversion requires a separate Annual Order Form.

## 4. Fees
*   **Pilot Fee**: $2,500 USD (One-time).
*   **Invoicing**: Due N30 from Start Date.
*   **Credit**: If Customer converts to an Annual Agreement within 30 days of Pilot end, the Pilot Fee will be credited against the first year's invoice.

## 5. Data Ownership & Handling
*   **Customer Data**: Customer retains all rights, title, and ownership of data submitted to AuditShield (Policies, User Metadata, Logs).
*   **AuditShield Rights**: AuditShield claims no ownership over Customer Data.
*   **Data Isolation**: Customer Data is stored in a logically isolated tenant structure. Customer acknowledges that AuditShield utilizes third-party subprocessors (Vercel, Neon) for hosting and storage.

## 6. Security & Access Controls
*   **Authentication**: Access is strictly controlled via Customer's Single Sign-On (SSO) or Identity Provider integration.
*   **Audit Logs**: AuditShield maintains an immutable log of all administrative actions taken within the Customer's tenant during the Pilot.
*   **Encryption**: All Customer Data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256).

## 7. Limitations & Disclaimers
*   **"As Is" Basis**: The Pilot Service is provided "As Is" without warranties of any kind.
*   **Support SLAs**: No uptime or support response time Service Level Agreements (SLAs) apply during the Pilot Period.
*   **No Certification**: Use of AuditShield does not constitute a SOC 2, ISO 27001, or legal certification of compliance. It provides tools to assist in such compliance.

## 8. Pilot Completion Outcomes
At the conclusion of the Pilot, the Customer will elect to either:
1.  **Convert**: Execute an Order Form for an Annual Enterprise Plan.
2.  **Conclude**: Terminate access. AuditShield will make available a data export of all Audit Logs and Reports for a period of 30 days, after which data may be deleted.

## 9. Confidentiality
Both parties agree to treat business, technical, and financial information disclosed during the Pilot as Confidential Information, protecting it with reasonable care and not disclosing it to third parties (except required subprocessors or legal counsel).
