**Introductions / Small Talk**
*(Skip. Get to the point.)*

**The "Why" Behind the Pricing**
"So, let me explain how we structure engagement, because it’s a little different from a standard SaaS usage seat model."

"We don't charge per seat because in compliance, you shouldn't be penalized for having more oversight. If you have 10 compliance officers or 100 developers, the audit log requirement is the same."

"We view our relationship in two distinct phases: **Verification** and **Operation**."

**Phase 1: The Pilot ($2,500 / 60 Days)**
"We always start with a fixed-scope Pilot. It’s $2,500 one-time, for 60 days."

"We do this instead of a 'Free Tier' because implementing governance requires real engineering resources—both yours and ours. We need to map your specific policies to our configuration, set up SSO, and ensure the immutable ledger is actually capturing the data your auditors care about."

"The goal of the 60 days isn't just to 'try it out'—it’s to generate a real, signed compliance report that you can hold in your hand. If we get to day 60 and that report doesn't meet your standard, we shake hands and part ways. No auto-renewal, no trap doors."

**Phase 2: Annual Enterprise ($15k / Year)**
"If the Pilot is successful—meaning you have the proof you need—we convert to an Annual Enterprise license. That starts at $15k per year."

"That covers the immutable retention of those logs, the ongoing hashing of new reports, and the SLA for availability. We also credit the $2,500 pilot fee back to you on that first year."

**Addressing "It's Expensive" / "No Monthly Option?"**
"We don't do month-to-month because compliance is a long game. An audit trail that disappears after 30 days is useless to an auditor looking at a year-long window. We need to commit to holding that data for the long haul, and we need partners who are serious about that long-term governance."

**Closing / The Ask**
"Does that structure—Prove it first, then commit—sound reasonable to your procurement team? If so, we can send over the Pilot order form today."
