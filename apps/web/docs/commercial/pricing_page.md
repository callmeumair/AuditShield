# AuditShield Pricing

## Governance proven. Not just promised.

AuditShield provides immutable, tamper-evident AI governance infrastructure for enterprises that require audit-ready proof of policy enforcement. We do not sell seats; we sell certainty.

---

### The Model: Proof-First Engagement

We do not offer usage-based pricing or month-to-month tiers. Our engagement model is designed for organizations with strict compliance requirements (SOC 2, ISO 27001) who need to validate the efficacy of their AI governance controls before committing to a long-term contract.

#### Primary Offering: Enterprise Pilot
**Cost**: $2,500 (One-time)
**Duration**: 60 Days

The Enterprise Pilot is a fixed-scope engagement designed to deploy, configure, and verify AuditShield within your specific environment. It is not a "free trial" but a structured proof-of-value period.

**What is Included:**
*   Full deployment of AuditShield SaaS instance.
*   Single Sign-On (SSO) integration via your Identity Provider.
*   Configuration of up to 5 custom AI governance policies.
*   Unlimited "Evidence Mode" verifications.
*   Direct access to engineering for initial policy mapping.
*   60 days of immutable log retention.

**What is Excluded:**
*   Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
*   Custom feature development.
*   On-premise deployment support.

**Pilot Outcomes:**
*   **Verification**: A demonstrated ability to detect and log policy violations.
*   **Audit Readiness**: Generation of at least one cryptographically signed compliance report.
*   **Operational Fit**: Confirmation that the workflow integrates without friction into your existing developer experience.

### Annual Enterprise Plan
**Starting at**: $15,000 / year
**Term**: Annual, billed upfront

Upon successful completion of the pilot, organizations convert to the Annual Enterprise Plan to maintain the immutable ledger and continue enforcement.

**Includes:**
*   Everything in the Pilot.
*   24/7 Priority Support.
*   7-Year Audit Log Retention (configurable).
*   Designated Success Manager.
*   Standard Service Level Agreement (99.9% Availability).
*   Full API Access for operational integration.

**Note**: The $2,500 pilot fee is credited toward the first year's contract upon conversion.

### Who This Is For
*   **Regulated Industries**: Healthcare, Finance, Insurance entities subject to strict oversight.
*   **Audit-Bound Companies**: Organizations currently preparing for or maintaining SOC 2 Type II or ISO 27001 certification.
*   **Security-Conscious CTOs**: Leaders who require cryptographic proof of governance, not just administrative checkboxes.

### Who This Is Not For
*   **Early Stage Startups**: If you do not have a compliance officer or a pending audit, AuditShield is likely overkill.
*   **Content Filtering Only**: If you strictly need real-time PII blocking without governance logs, other tools may be more appropriate.
